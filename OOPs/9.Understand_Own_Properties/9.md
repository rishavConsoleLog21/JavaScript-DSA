In the following example, the Bird constructor defines two properties: name and numLegs:
    function Bird(name) {
        this.name = name;
        this.numLegs = 2;
    }

    let duck = new Bird("Donald");
    let canary = new Bird("Tweety");

name and numLegs are called own propertiesm, because they are defined directly on the instance object. That means that duck and canary each has its own separate copy of thse properties. The following code adds all of the own properties of duck to the array onwProps:

let ownProps = [];

for (let property in duck) {
  if(duck.hasOwnProperty(property)) {
    ownProps.push(property);
  }
}

console.log(ownProps);
The console would display the value ["name", "numLegs"].
